# Next.js App Directory Playground

Next.js introduced the `app/` directory (beta). This is the result of the [Layouts RFC](https://nextjs.org/blog/layouts-rfc) previously published for community feedback. This includes support for:

- **Layouts:** Easily share UI while preserving state and avoiding re-renders.
- **Server Components:** Making server-first the default for the most dynamic applications.
- **Streaming:** Display instant loading states and stream in updates.
- **Suspense for Data Fetching:** `async`/`await` support and the `use` hook for component-level fetching.

The `app/` directory can coexist with the existing `pages` directory for incremental adoption. While you **don't need to use the `app/` directory** when upgrading to Next.js 13, we're laying the foundations to build complex interfaces while shipping less JavaScript.
